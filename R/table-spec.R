# The <mdl_gt> specification ---------------------------------------------------
#
# `mdl_gt()` lifts a fitted `mdl_tbl` into a declarative S7 specification.
# Small pipeable verbs record effect, cell-group, layout, label, and style
# instructions; the build pipeline resolves them only at inspection or render.
# Cell groups are keyed by stable ids, so add-verb call order cannot determine
# placement.
#
# This file owns the S7 class, constructor, public grammar verbs, validation,
# and print method. The semantic build, layout compiler, and renderer live in
# table-build.R, table-layout.R, and table-render.R respectively.

# `mdl_tbl` is a vctrs vector type and stays one; this registers it as an S3
# class *object* so S7 can name it -- as the type of the spec's `mdl_tbl`
# property below, and (in principle) as a dispatch class for S7 generics.
# Registering, not converting: the two class systems refer to each other, and
# `mdl_tbl` keeps all its vctrs vectorization. See `vignette("s7")`.

#' The `<mdl_gt>` table specification
#'
#' @description
#'
#' `r lifecycle::badge('experimental')`
#'
#' `mdl_gt()` lays a collection of fitted models out on the *mesa* -- the table
#' upon which the models are displayed -- as a declarative specification. The
#' division of labor with [model_table()] is deliberate: **which models sit on
#' the mesa is decided on the `mdl_tbl`**, with ordinary `dplyr` verbs over its
#' provenance columns (`outcome`, `exposure`, `strata`, ...) and the family
#' columns (`family`, `pattern`, `relation`) the table carries -- pare, print,
#' verify. `mdl_gt()`
#' is then the gate: it verifies what arrives is *one presentable analysis*
#' (see Details) and takes no selection arguments, putting everything fitted
#' on the mesa with default labels drawn from the term table and the attached
#' data. From there the table is grown one **display** decision at a time with
#' pipeable verbs, exactly the way a `{ggplot2}` plot is grown:
#'
#' - `select_adjustment()` chooses which rungs of the adjustment ladder are
#'   displayed (e.g. only the crude and fully adjusted rows --
#'   [adjustment_sets()] shows the rungs and the numbers they are selected
#'   by), and `select_terms()` which terms' cells are shown;
#' - the `add_*()` verbs activate named cell groups derived from models and
#'   attached data (estimates, events, rates, sample sizes, forest views);
#' - `modify_layout()` maps semantic dimensions onto rows and columns, while
#'   [place_cells()] moves whole cell groups without recomputing statistics;
#' - `modify_labels()` relabels outcomes, terms, and levels late, without
#'   reselecting;
#' - [inspect_mdl_gt()] exposes the effects, measures, groups, and cells before
#'   `{gt}` rendering;
#' - `as_gt()` renders the specification to a `{gt}` table (see [as_gt()]).
#'
#' Because the specification is declarative -- the verbs record instructions and
#' resolution happens only at [as_gt()]/`print()` -- the verbs may arrive in any
#' order. **A verb replaces only what you name.** Repeating a verb with the
#' same instruction -- the same selection dimension, group id, style field,
#' or label name -- replaces just that instruction with a message, and leaves
#' everything else recorded on the specification standing (the `{ggplot2}`
#' `labs()` merge behavior); calling a `select_*()` verb with no arguments
#' clears that dimension, which is the way to undo an earlier selection. A
#' bare `mdl_gt(mt) |> as_gt()` already renders a minimal estimate-and-interval
#' table, so the grammar is usable from the first verb.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The semantic unit is an **effect**: outcome x focal term/contrast x model
#' context, optionally conditioned by stratum and modifier levels. Estimates,
#' confidence bounds, p-values, counts, events, and rates are atomic measures
#' attached at their declared semantic grain. Named cell groups present those
#' measures: `effect` may merge or separate the estimate and interval, while
#' `forest` reads the same three measures without calculating new statistics.
#' Layout changes only project those stable effects and measures into cells.
#'
#' `mdl_gt()` validates before it builds. The object must be a `mdl_tbl`; only
#' its fitted rows are laid out (failed and unfit rows are set aside); the
#' table must hold a single model family (one fitting function, on one link)
#' or it errors; and more than one attached dataset is reported with a
#' message.
#'
#' It then verifies the models form **one presentable analysis**, in the terms
#' of the table's family columns: a single formula family (an adjustment ladder,
#' a mediation triad, parallel adjustment sets, or a lone model), or several
#' families bound by a shared relation -- `varied exposures` or `varied
#' outcomes` over one adjustment ladder, the wide-table shapes. Unrelated
#' families error, pointing back at the `mdl_tbl`: read its `family` column,
#' `dplyr::filter()` it down, and lay out one analysis at
#' a time. See [model_table()] for the collection these are drawn from and
#' [attach_data()] for supplying the data that categorical levels and
#' data-derived statistics are read from.
#'
#' @param object A `mdl_tbl` object holding at least one fitted model
#'
#' @param x A `<mdl_gt>` specification (for the verbs and `print()`)
#'
#' @param ... For `mdl_gt()`, unused -- it deliberately takes no selection
#'   arguments, and an unused argument errors; for the selection verbs,
#'   labeled-formula selection input (a `formula`, a `list` of formulas, or a
#'   `character` vector -- see [labeled_formulas_to_named_list()]), or nothing
#'   at all to clear that dimension's selection; for `print()`, unused
#'

#' `modify_labels()` rethinks a label without reselecting anything. It absorbs
#' the old `level_labels` argument of the retired `tbl_*` functions, so its
#' labeled formulas may name either a term (the variable) or a specific level:
#'
#' - a variable with a scalar label relabels the **term**
#'   (`smoking ~ "Smoking status"`);
#' - a variable with a vector label relabels the term's **levels** in

#' - a bare level value relabels that **level** wherever it appears

#' - an outcome relabels its **row group** (`mpg ~ "Miles per gallon"`); a
#'   name that is both a displayed term and an outcome -- a mediator --
#'   relabels both.
#'
#' Column (statistic) relabelings are supplied through `columns` and consumed

#' Style a `<mdl_gt>` at render
#'
#' @description
#'
#' `r lifecycle::badge('experimental')`
#'
#' `modify_style()` records style instructions, applied when the table is
#' rendered by [as_gt()]:
#'
#' - `accents` emphasize the cells that meet a criterion. Each accent is a
#'   two-sided formula whose **left side** is a criterion on any displayed
#'   statistic (`p < 0.05`, `estimate > 1`, `rate >= 10`) and whose **right
#'   side** is the instruction: `"bold"`, `"italic"`, or a text color (any
#'   color name or hex value); several may be combined
#'   (`p < 0.05 ~ c("bold", "italic")`). A criterion is evaluated once per
#'   term-level within each row, against all of that context's statistics, and
#'   accents every cell of the context -- so `p < 0.05 ~ "bold"` bolds both the
#'   estimate and the p-value it belongs to. The recognized statistic names
#'   are `estimate` (alias `beta`), `conf_low`, `conf_high`, `p` (alias
#'   `p_value`), `n`, `events`, `rate`, and `rate_difference`.
#' - `digits` sets the table-wide formatting default. A column block's own
#'   `digits` still wins for its columns; p-values keep their three-decimal
#'   rule.
#' - `missing_text` fills every cell with nothing to show (reference levels,
#'   estimates a model did not produce). The default is an empty cell.
#' - `padding` scales the table's vertical row padding (as
#'   [gt::opt_vertical_padding()] does). A table carrying a forest column
#'   defaults to `0` -- the dense canvas its plot cells need to read as one --
#'   and this overrides that default.
#'
#' Like every verb, `modify_style()` merges: naming `digits` again after an
#' earlier `accents` call replaces only `digits`, with a message naming it --
#' the accents already recorded stand. Each of `accents`, `digits`,
#' `missing_text`, and `padding` replaces only itself.
#'
#' @param x A `<mdl_gt>` specification
#' @param accents A formula or list of formulas: `criterion ~ instruction`
#'   (see Description)
#' @param digits Number of digits estimates are formatted to
